## Project Overview
Our project focuses on eco-friendly innovations within the Sustainability Tech track. We propose to develop a community engagement waste management platform that empowers citizens to actively participate in waste management by reporting waste and promoting its collection. The platform will be built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for an optimized user experience and clean, maintainable code.

## Problem Statement
The global waste crisis continues to escalate, with improper waste disposal leading to pollution, health hazards, and environmental degradation. Cities struggle to manage waste efficiently, and community engagement remains low, particularly in developing regions. There is an urgent need for an accessible solution that leverages technology to involve citizens in waste reporting and management.

## Proposed Solution
We are building a Community Engagement Waste Management Platform that enables users to report waste, contribute to its collection, and earn rewards for their actions. Key features of the platform include:

- **Image-based Waste Reporting:** Users can upload images of waste they encounter in their surroundings, initiating a report.
- **Gemini AI Waste Classification:** Our platform incorporates Gemini AI to automatically detect and classify the type of waste—plastic, paper, glass, metal, or organic—and estimate its quantity from the uploaded image.
- **Location Input with Google Autocomplete:** Users provide the waste location using Google Autocomplete, which makes the process quicker and more accurate by suggesting nearby addresses as they type.
- **User Rewards and Leaderboard:** Users earn points for submitting reports, which can later be exchanged for rewards. Additionally, a leaderboard tracks top-performing users to encourage participation.

The platform will be built using the Next.js framework to ensure high performance through server-side rendering, while TypeScript will enforce type safety, making the codebase more reliable and easier to maintain. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, providing a modern, responsive design that enhances user interaction and platform usability.

## Project Goals and Expected Outcomes
Our platform aims to:
- Increase community participation in waste management by offering a simple, tech-enabled reporting system.
- Improve waste collection efficiency by providing real-time, geo-tagged data to local authorities.
- Foster environmental responsibility through a reward-based system that incentivizes waste reporting and collection.

We expect to see increased waste reporting and improved waste management processes as communities engage with the platform. Additionally, the classification data from Gemini AI will help waste management agencies better understand the types of waste being generated and improve recycling efforts.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Development
- Build the web and mobile platform using Next.js, with functionalities for user registration, waste reporting, and the reward system.
- Utilize TypeScript for ensuring a robust, scalable codebase.
- Apply Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design and enhanced user experience.
- Integrate Gemini AI for waste classification and Google’s location autocomplete feature.

### Phase 2: Testing & Launch
- Conduct beta testing with community groups to refine the user experience and improve AI accuracy.
- Officially launch the platform in selected pilot areas.

### Phase 3: Expansion & Community Building
- Expand the platform to additional regions and integrate more localized waste collection services.
- Build partnerships with recycling centers and environmental agencies to ensure the proper handling of reported waste.

## Sustainability & Long-Term Vision
Our long-term vision is to create a scalable platform that can be implemented globally. By partnering with governments and waste management organizations, we hope to influence waste management policies and promote eco-friendly practices through technology and community engagement.

We believe that our Community Engagement Waste Management Platform, built on modern technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, will significantly contribute to solving urban waste challenges, while educating and incentivizing communities to take ownership of their environment.
